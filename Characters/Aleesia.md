Aleesia of House Crystal Leaf

# Elf Wizard (Kalashtar mechanically)

Clan name in elfic is pronounced Saelinifethkhracharmkaender which is hard to pronounce and remember for those who do not speak elfic.

Has a Dream spirit which shares half of her mind.

Spirit name: Azure

Spirit nickname: The Silent Necromancer.

Communication: Can communicate through dreams (nothing clear) and feelings (e.g. Augury spell).

Obtained: Ritual passed threw her family. Her grand-father Theoris passed it to her when she was 4. It usually passes a generation until the current Kalashatar’s health is in danger. The spirit has a chance of dying when the mind which is shared dies.

Mother: Her mother Naedithas always hated Aleesia for having Azure instead of getting it herself so they are not close together.

Father: Aleesia is close to her father Kaebalar, he instructed her on most of the knowledge she knows. 

She doesn’t really know much about Azure, she knows that a lot of Kalashtar who had him were very powerful and some were very feared. One of the very first was a powerful mute necromancer from which Azure somehow kept the nickname.

Why is she adventuring? She was bored, always being kept safe inside. Only going out for meetings. She would otherwise be let out once a year on the night of the lanterns where there was a giant festival and there would be thousands of lanterns let out.

How trustworthy is she? Not a lot. She was always protected by her family, telling her that the whole exterior world is dangerous. At least she can read mind which helps her get at ease quickly.

Scared of? Bugs and other creepy things and dragons (have you heard all of the stories???)

What motivates her? Knowledge and Power (but she sometimes takes Power granted)

Is a little bit of a princess about not sleeping in a bed.

Grew up in Lanua’ri in a great mansion. Very beautiful with lots of flowers and even a waterfall.

Likes books a lot, almost has much has she likes to simply get the information directly from the mind of people.

Secret: She keeps the spirit a secret and the fact that she can read mind (it’s not as useful if people know).

Failures: Her misunderstanding the mind of a businessman when she 12 which made her family lose a great amount of money and power and was the only time that she got her dad mad. She was punished and her powers sealed for a month. She never felt as alone during that time when it seemed a part of her was missing.

Food: She loves fruit very much, mango and strawberries in particular.
